# Public-Relations
Version 2.0 https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/xmrhaelan-monero-public-relations

**Overview:** The purpose of the Monero Public Relations, Outreach & Education Plan (PR, O&E Plan) is to provide strategy and tools to support the education, reputation, and user adoption of Monero. This PR, O&E plan and its accompanying tools will provide Monero developers, community members, and various journalists and bloggers with the information needed to help us facilitate the eventual realization and mass adoption of the most useful, private (confidential), and robust cryptocurrency in existence.

We aim to ensure the public is informed of the many benefits of privacy and fungibility in cryptocurrencies. As a result, an outcome of our efforts should be to prevent governments or institutions from placing unnecessary bans or restrictions on their use and mass adoption. Monero is the vanguard of fungible and private (confidential) cryptocurrency technologies. Education of Monero and education of the need to safeguard those technologies are synonymous.
