# How to contribute

**What do we do?**
Education and communications around the value of Monero

**How does this works?**
1. Go to the 'issues' pages and find task/items to be completed. (Some are funded, some are not - they will be indicated by a tag)
2. Each issue should have the necessary information for the task to be completed. However if you have any questions, just @message the issue creator for clarification. Or ask an active contributor from our telegram / wire chatrooms.
3. Once you have completed the task, create a pull request with the contents of the completed task and within that pull request, reference the issue/task you are completing + your xmr address.
4. Issue creators, the communitiy and other moderators will give feedback and see if the work fits what the issue was looking for.
5. If all lights are green, your pull request will be accepted and if the task was funded then the contribution xmr reward will be sent to your address.

**Join one of our chats and introduce yourself:**
- What part of the world are you from?
- Any other involvements in the crypto space?
- What you would love to get suck in with?

Our main chat is on WIRE and we don't have a invite link for that.

1. DM [@pet3rpan_](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_) on twitter for an invite link or join our telegram ([depreciated](https://t.me/joinchat/DM8-zRAVi-tEx-1PEltAIg))
