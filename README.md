This will contain resources for the Monero Meetup Kit, an upcomming FFS proposal to increase local community engagement.

## Translations

Some documents in this repository need to be localized in as many languages as possibile. Right now the priority is the Flyer. You can find it in this repository with the name `moneromeetup_kitflyer_v*.pdf` where `*` is the version. Please make sure that the version in this repository is the same as the one [on Taiga](https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/sgp-monero-meetup-kit/wiki/flyers) (You will always find the last version on Taiga)

### Add a translation

1. Clone the repository locally
2. Add a subfolder for your language ([check existing folders](https://github.com/erciccione/monero-meetup-kit/tree/master/translations))
3. Get a copy of the last version of the flyer (you can find it in this repository under the name `moneromeetup_kitflyer_v*.pdf` where `*` is the version) and translate it using a pdf editor
4. When done upload it in the correct folder (e.g. if It's a spanish translation will go under /es/ , if the subfolder doesn't exist, creat one. Your translation file will result in /`/translations/es/moneromeetup_kitflyer_v*.pdf`)
5. push your changes to your remote repository and open a Pull Request
