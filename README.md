# How to contribute

**What do we do?**

Education and communications around the value of Monero. This involve writing, creating educational material and completing other general Monero tasks.

**How does this works?**

1. Go to the 'issues' pages and find task to be completed. (Some are funded, some are not - they will be indicated by a tag)
2. Each issue should have the necessary information for the task to be completed. However if you have any questions, just @message the issue creator for clarification. Or ask an active contributor from our telegram / wire chatrooms.
3. Once you have completed the task, create a pull request with the contents of the completed task and within that pull request, reference the issue/task you are completing + your xmr address.
4. Issue creators, the communitiy and other moderators will give feedback and see if the work fits what the issue was looking for.
5. If all lights are green, your pull request will be accepted and if the task was funded then the contribution xmr reward will be sent to your address.

**What are tasks?**

Tasks are for creating a request for a task to be completed. 

Anyone can create and request tasks to be done. These tasks are not funded by default but we will be working towards getting as much work to be rewarded by XMR. Funded tasks will be indicated through the issue. All issues uploaded will be watched and may be automatically funded at the discretion of the moderators. If you are planning on working on anything related to writing, education or public relations for Monero, create an issue and it may just be picked up for funding. Any fair requests for funding will highly likely to be matched. Just ask :)

To claim any tasks, users need to submit a pull request with the completed task content. For smaller tasks, in order to keep it simpler, the first successful pull request will recieve the reward as (with exceptions) and for larger projects, there will be greater judgement involved.
