# monero-meetup-kit

This repository contains the files of the Monero Meetup Kit that need to be translated

## Translations

Some documents in this repository need to be localized in as many languages as possibile. Right now the priority is the Flyer. You can find it in this repository in three different versions. Please make sure that the version in this repository is the same as the one [on Taiga](https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/sgp-monero-meetup-kit/wiki/flyers) (You will always find the last version on Taiga)

### Add a translation

1. Clone the repository locally
2. Add a subfolder for your language ([check existing folders](https://github.com/erciccione/monero-meetup-kit/tree/master/translations))
3. Get a copy of the file you want to translate.
If you want to translate the flyer, you can choose between 3 files:
- `moneromeetup_kitflyer_v*.pdf` - The full flyer 
- `moneromeetup_kitflyer_v*_nomarks.pdf` -  no marks
- `translate_v40.rtf` - Only text
(`*` is the last version)
4. Translate
5. When done, upload it in the correct folder (e.g. if It's a spanish translation will go under /es/ , if the subfolder doesn't exist, make one. Your translation file will result, for example:
`/translations/es/moneromeetup_kitflyer_v*.pdf`)
6. push your changes to your remote repository and open a Pull Request
