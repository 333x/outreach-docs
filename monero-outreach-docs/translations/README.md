# Monero Outreach Translations

If you have any questions regarding the monero terminology, take a look at the [monero-translations](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-translations), and open the file of the language you are looking for. You can also find tips for translators.

 * Remember to create the directory with your [country code](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim/Country_Codes), inside the `translations` directory. You can `Copy` and `paste` the `en` directory and just change the name and start working.

## Goal

Translate as to many languages all the documentation provided by the Monero Outreach Workgroup.
