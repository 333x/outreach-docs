# Monero Outreach

Welcome to the Monero Outreach Localization. This directory contains all the final versions of the documents published by the Monero Outreach Workgroup. You will also find the translation directory. 

## Goal

Our goal as a community is to create infrastructure and tools that can be used as an information bridge between core developers, community members, and the general public. We aim to ensure the public is informed of the many benefits of privacy and fungibility in cryptocurrencies.

### Contributing

Please review the translations tips (standardized terms) we expect everyone to follow: https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-translations/blob/master/translation-tips.md.

Follow this instructions (if you are not familiar with Github, check out this [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)):

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork locally.
2. The directory `en` has all the latest documents.
3. If you are working on a new language, add a `subfolder` for your language in the `translations` folder (use [country codes](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim/Country_Codes) for the `subfolders`). Copy the folder you are going to translate from the `en` folder and paste it in the `subfolder` you just created.
4. **File Formats** - Documents are in .md format. Md stands for markdown and is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It's really easy to use and you can use any text editor to add text.
 - We were currently using .sla files but due to document size and workload, @erciccione suggested to change or reduce size format so we decided to make the translations on a much lightweighted format. Design edits will be done once you submit your work. If you need help, please get in contact with us.
5. When saving changes, remember to add a message to the commit with a description of **the documents name and the language** (e.g. **_"Quickfacts fr translation"_**, **_"Missing punctuation donttalk PSA pt_Br"_**, etc.).
6. If you are a reviewer please visit, [Taiga EPIC #69 Monero Outreach Localization](https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/xmrhaelan-monero-public-relations/epic/69) to get assigned a translation.
7. Happy contributing!
