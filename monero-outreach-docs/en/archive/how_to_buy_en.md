# How To Buy Monero

**“Monero is easy to buy, here’s what you need to know about buying it privately.” - 23th of July, 2020**

Monero is a privacy coin, that’s why we’re all here. So while we’ll discuss all the ways to buy Monero—including non-private methods—it will all be from the perspective of Monero’s main purpose, privacy. The Monero blockchain itself is private, but everything else is under surveillance and will compromise your privacy when buying Monero (XMR). A rule of thumb is that your overall level of privacy will be determined by the properties of the currency you use to buy it. The properties of currency relevant to buying Monero are the following:

- _fungibility_ - The idea is that 1 XMR will always be equal to another 1 XMR no matter its history and cannot be tainted or discriminated against. Fungibility can be enforced by government policy or created by privacy-focused technology, as with Monero.
- _decentralization_ - Currency centralization is about control and surveillance. Any centralized payment method to buy Monero is heavily watched. The other effect of centralization when it comes to buying XMR is the tendency toward high transaction fees.
- _immutability_ - Transactions should be unchangeable by anyone for any reason. This means that no one can reverse your payments or freeze your funds. Decentralized immutability is the whole point of blockchain technology.

Whatever currency you use to buy Monero will have pros and cons relating to these properties that you will need to weigh against your individual use case and desired privacy.

### _But First, Two Things to Stay Safe_
---

**“Not your keys,
not your Monero.”**
_-All the Cool Kids_

1. Until the XMR is in your wallet, it is not your XMR and you are not benefiting from Monero’s privacy. However you buy your Monero, always transfer to your wallet, to your keys.
2. Use subaddresses and not your main address when receiving XMR. These are disposable addresses that help protect your privacy. They also help you organize incoming transactions since the sender’s privacy is also being protected by Monero and you won’t otherwise know who sent what.

### _Buy Monero with Electricity_
---

Ok, so this is mining Monero, not buying Monero. But we just wanted to point out that mining is the most private way to get Monero and it helps to strengthen the network for everyone. Mining is outside the scope of this article, but you can learn more at [Mine Monero to Strengthen the Network](https://www.monerooutreach.org/monero_best_practices/mine-to-support-the-network.html).

### _Buy Monero with Cash_
---

Cash is one of the few currencies that is almost as fungible as Monero. Most bills have a serial number and can be tracked, but in regular, everyday usage, cash is practically fungible. While less common, trading XMR for gold, silver or other unmarked precious commodities is also untraceable. Cash transactions are usually done in person, which allow the buyer and seller to have control over the privacy level of the transaction. However, meeting in person isn’t always easy or risk-free and will tend to be geographically limited. The site [localmonero.co](https://localmonero.co/) can help you find people selling XMR for cash in your area.

_**Pros**_

- Private/Fungible
- Decentralized
- Low/Free Transaction Cost

_**Cons**_

- Inconvenient

### _Buy Monero with a Bearer Instrument_
---

Bearer Instrument is just a fancy term that means if it’s in your pocket, you’ve proven that it’s yours. Winning lottery tickets and some bonds are bearer instruments, but the ones that will help you buy Monero will be United States Postal Service (USPS) Money Orders and to a much lesser extent, cashier’s checks.

Bisq supports USPS Money Orders. While only available in the United States, you can buy $3,000 worth of money orders per day in the U.S. without identification. Additionally this can be purchased with cash to further increase your privacy. Vist [bisq.wiki/US_Postal_Money_Order](https://bisq.wiki/US_Postal_Money_Order) for more information on how this works and how to stay safe. At the time of writing, a money order will cost $1.25 or $1.70 depending on the amount.

A cashier’s check made out to cash also provides a degree of privacy since it’s literally a check from the bank that is drawn from their account and not yours. You will be in a KYC scenario with the bank you buy the check from, but up to a certain amount you will at least be below the AML reporting. After all that, the benefit would be relative anonymity against anything short of a supeona.

_**Pros**_

- Anonymous
- Inexpensive

_**Cons**_

- Inconvenient

### _Buy Monero at an ATM_
---

Many Monero ATMs take cash and often smaller transactions can be completed anonymously. ATM owners may have slightly difference polices on this, but Know-Your-Customer/Anti-Money-Laundering (KYC/AML) regulations invariably kick in at a certain transaction amount and your transaction data would be stored by the ATM provider no matter the amount. The site coinatmradar.com provides a searchable map of Monero ATMs.

_**Pros**_

- Anonymous for Small Amounts

_**Cons**_

- Expensive
- Geographically Limited
- Transaction Data is Stored

### _Buy Monero with Crypto_
---

If you already have crypto that you’d like to trade for Monero you have quite a few options. Bitcoin-to-Monero (BTC-XMR) is by far the most common trading pair and fiat on-ramp you’ll find, but Binance maintains Ethereum-to-Monero (ETH-XMR), and more are sure to follow. If you have another type of cryptocurrency, you will need to first convert that to one you can exchange directly for XMR, which can often be done using the same exchange. There are three main types of exchanges that you can use.

#### P2P - Peer to Peer Exchange
You can deposit your BTC into a private and decentralized exchange like [bisq.network](https://bisq.network/) for the most privacy. P2P exchanges are decentralized and allow people to trade crypto without a third party.

#### Non-KYC Exchange
Exchanges like [morphtoken.com](https://www.morphtoken.com/) and [tradeogre.com](https://tradeogre.com/) are centralized but aren’t KYC because they don’t provide a fiat ramp. [cakewallet.com](https://cakewallet.com/) has a feature that allows you to swap Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Dash for Monero in the wallet. This is nice for people who would like to trade for Monero but don’t want to create another exchange account.

#### Centralized KYC Exchange
Lastly, you could also deposit into any conventional exchange that offers a BTC-XMR trading pair. It’s important to remember that until you withdraw your XMR into your wallet, it is neither private nor secure.

_**Pros**_

- Convenient

_**Cons**_

- Not Private

### _Buy Monero with Credit/Debit Card_
---

A credit card transaction of any kind is fully centralized and not private at all. That shouldn’t come as a shock, but it’s worse than you might think. We assume that the credit card company has all the information about our transaction but we don’t often think about the payment processors and network owners also having that data. With the regularity of data breaches these days, a credit card transaction has a very large surface area of exposure. Additionally it’s common for these transactions to cross borders without your knowing. You may be making a purchase at a local store using a local bank card, but it’s likely that your data is being sent through and stored in the United States. With that caveat, using a credit card with a direct Monero on-ramp is the quickest and simplest way to buy XMR and our [Investor Resources](https://www.monerooutreach.org/investors/) page provides a list of exchanges where you can buy Monero directly.

Prepaid credit cards can provide anonymity so long as there is no other meta-data to connect you to that card. If you buy the pre-paid card with cash and don’t use it for any other purchases, you would have a reasonable level of privacy.

_**Pros**_

- Convenient

_**Cons**_

- Not Private
- Centralized
- High Risk of Breach

### _Buy Monero with Bank Transfer_
---

Bank transfers are most commonly used for larger OTC (Over-The-Counter) transactions. It’s worth looking at wire payments as distinct from credit/debit even if it’s the same bank offering all three services, as they are routed differently. Credit/debit transactions run through the same processors and networks as any other credit card. Similarly, any email-transfer services will tend to be run on a third-party network. But account-to-account transfers and formal wire transfers follow a different path. An internal account transfer is done within that bank’s network which just means that the data of that transaction exists in fewer places and would settle instantly. A wire transfer however introduces new surveillance groups, most notably in the destination bank and intermediary banks, but also SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication). If your wire is going into or out of the United States it will also pass through the Office of Foreign Asset Controls and FedWire.

_**Pros**_

- Suitable for large amounts

_**Cons**_

- Not Private
- Centralized
- Expensive & Inconvenient

### _Buy Monero with Paypal_
---

Paypal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Venmo or Western Union type services are not private and can be expensive. These money transfer services will also have their own Terms of Service and policies that may open you up to additional risk. With Paypal in particular, XMR sellers need to be careful as transactions can be reversed and PayPal’s policy is to side with the buyer in the event of a dispute. In an example scam, Alice agrees to buy 1 XMR for X Dollars from Bob. Alice sends Bob X dollars via Paypal, and then Bob sends Alice 1 XMR. Alice files a dispute with Paypal and is refunded the X dollars, and she keeps the immutable Monero.

_**Pros**_

- Convenient

_**Cons**_

- Not Private
- Centralized
- Expensive
