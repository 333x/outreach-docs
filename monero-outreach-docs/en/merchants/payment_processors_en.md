# Monero Payment Processors

A payment processor coordinates and automates your Monero transactions. It works on behalf of your wallet to intergrate XMR payments with your other systems and can automate how your funds get routed. It’s a little robot that runs your Monero wallet for you.

### _Open-Source Payment Processors_

FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) payment processors will be more private, won’t have additional fees and won’t have Terms of Service (ToS) restrictions. You’ll need just a very basic technical understanding to set these up, most configurations do not require any programming. But since you have full control of the software and hardware, open-source gateways allow you to fully customize the code for your needs. For fiat conversions, you would use your preferred Monero exchange manually or automatically with their API.

### _Payment Processor Services_

Third-party services will be simpler to setup and maintain, and most won’t require additional hardware but at the cost of decreased privacy and increased fees. While much of the functionality will be similar, these providers often add additional value by developing apps and control panels designed for merchants. The other advantage with using a service provider is access to customer/technical support.
