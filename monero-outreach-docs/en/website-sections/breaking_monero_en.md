# Breaking Monero

Breaking Monero is a series of episodes by Justin Ehrenhofer, Sarang Noether and Brandon Goodell (Surae Noether) from Monero Research Lab that explain the limitations of Monero’s security and privacy in an easy to understand way. They give a sneak peek into some of the work done behind the scenes to evaluate risks and to make Monero better.

#### _Breaking Monero 01: Introduction_
[Introduction to the Breaking Monero series.](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/introduction.html)

#### _Breaking Monero 02: Ring Signatures Introduction_
[We discuss the history of Monero’s ring signatures and past approaches to improve them.](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/ring-signatures.html)

#### _Breaking Monero 03: 0-Decoy and Chain Reactions_
[Sarang and Justin discuss 0-decoy (0-mixin) rings, perhaps the oldest and best-studied past limitation of Monero.](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/decoy-chain-reactions.html)

#### _Breaking Monero 04: Chain Splits (Key Image Reuse Attack)_
[In this episode, Sarang, Brandon (Suare), and Justin introduce key image reuse concerns.](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/chain-splits.html)

#### _Breaking Monero 05: Input Selection Algorithm_
[In this episode, Sarang and Justin explain more about how Monero selects decoys for ring signatures, more than just “randomly.”](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/input-selection-algorithm.html)

#### _Breaking Monero 06: Unusual Ringsize_
[In this short episode, we discuss the unfortunate tradeoff when sending Monero transactions with unusual ringsizes.](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/unusual-ringsize.html)

#### _Breaking Monero 07: Remote Nodes_
[We discuss some of these limitations, some remote node attacks, and how to mitigate against them.](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/remote-nodes.html)

#### _Breaking Monero 08: Timing Attacks_
[We discuss some of the network topography concerns and offer some ways for users to mitigate their exposure to timing heuristics.](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/timing-attacks.html)

#### _Breaking Monero 09: Poisoned Outputs (EAE Attack)_
[Monero’s ring signatures provide plausible deniability, but they aren’t perfect.](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/poisoned-outputs.html)

#### _Breaking Monero 10: Public Mining Pools_
[Public mining pools provide a service to miners, but they also reveal a lot of output information that observers can use to learn more about transactions.](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/public-mining-pools.html)

#### _Breaking Monero 11: Mailbag Episode_
[In this episode, we answer several questions from audience members.](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/mailbag-episode.html)

#### _Breaking Monero 12: Input/Output Metadata_
[We discuss how the metadata collected by looking at the number of inputs and outputs can limit privacy in some circumstances.](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/metadata.html)

#### _Breaking Monero 13: Blockchain Explorer OpSec_
[This is a quick reminder to pay attention to the information you give block explorers.](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/blockchain-explorers.php)

#### _Breaking Monero 14: Subaddress Association (Janus Attack)_
[A discussion about Monero subaddress association that can be done with off-chain and on-chain transactions.](https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/subaddress-association-janus-attack.html)
