# Monero Means Money: Artwork

Monero community volunteers freely donated their time and effort to create this film to support the airing of independent voices and independent films. Many small and independently owned cinemas are struggling with suspended operations during the COVID-19 outbreak. 100% of the net revenue from Monero Means Money will be given to independent theatres, including Laemmle Theaters in Los Angeles and the Tampa Theatre in Florida.
