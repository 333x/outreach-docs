# Monero Means Money Movie Removed From #1 List

**“The Top Movie in America Last Weekend Was about privacy...briefly.” - 21th of April, 2020**

Amid warnings on government privacy intrusions during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number-one movie in America — if only briefly — was about privacy. It temporarily had the sales to be #1 as its weekend sales exceeded the entire weekend (4/10-4/12) box office of other movies. It was listed as #1 for a couple hours and then was promptly removed from the movie industry data website [The Numbers](https://web.archive.org/web/20200413125904/https://www.the-numbers.com/weekend-box-office-chart).

This movie, Monero Means Money: Cryptocurrency 101, Live from Leipzig, was fielded by a self-organizing group of volunteer hacktivists who set out with a plan to be the #1 movie while all the nation’s theaters were closed for the pandemic. Their purpose was to raise awareness of the encroachment of privacy rights and raise money for independent cinemas. The project was successful, with the movie generating $3,430 in sales during the opening days.

The film premiered on Friday, April 10, at Laemmle Theaters in Los Angeles to purchased—but—unfilled seats. With proceeds supporting independent theaters, the Monero community rallied to buy tickets with credit cards, Monero, and other cryptocurrencies at the website [moneromeans.money](https://moneromeans.money/). The movie is also featured at the Tampa Theatre in Tampa, Florida, as part of their Limelight Speaker Series from 4/14 - 4/27 and has been shown in the empty Parkway Theater & FIlm Lounge outside Pittsburgh.

While the goal of this project was to be accepted by the film industry as the #1 film, the organizers took the dismissal by the industry with good humor. “Please see this fun experiment and achievement as a testament to belief in Monero and the strength of Monero’s community,” said Justin Ehrenhofer, producer of Monero Means Money. “We hope it motivates others to discover Monero and to join the community.”

In the film, cryptocurrency expert Dr. Daniel Kim describes the technical, economic, and social impact of various forms of money, including traditional currency, Bitcoin, and Monero. Dr. Kim explains that Monero best meets the requirements of digital scarcity and digital privacy.

“Our world is becoming increasingly digital, including our money, but most digital information is easily tracked,” said Howard Chu, Chief Technology Officer at Symas and co-designer of Monero’s proof-of-work RandomX. “Monero is unique in bringing money into the digital realm without sacrificing the privacy of physical cash.”

Monero amounts by default don’t have a knowable history or origin, so any Monero is exchangeable for any other, as with cash. Individuals and businesses that want to buy and sell with cryptocurrency as they do with cash and other private payment methods benefit by using Monero.

“Please see this fun experiment and achievement as a testament to belief in Monero and the strength of Monero’s community,” said Justin Ehrenhofer, producer of Monero Means Money. “We hope it motivates others to look into and use Monero and to join the community.”

As Dr. Kim states in the movie, “A surveillance state in which everybody’s financial transactions are tracked and surveilled and looked at is not an open society that we want to be living in.”
