Premiere & Theater Release

The film premiered on April 10th at Laemmle Theaters (laemmle.com/film/monero-means-money-cryptocurrency-101-live-leipzig) in Los Angeles, California and debuted at the Tampa Theatre (tampatheatre.org/movie/monero-means-money) in Tampa, Florida on April 14th as part of their Limelight Speaker Series.

| US Box Office/Weekend 15 - April 10-12 | US Box Office/Week 15 - April 10-16 | Raised & Given to Independent Theaters |
|--|--|--|
| **$3,430** | **$3,500** | **$2,500+** |

While the movie has outsold the entire US box office since its release, its #1 status still has not been recognized by the industry charts. And that’s ok, becoming #1 was a fun idea, but it’s just a vehicle for the message of privacy and the effort to help independent cinemas and independent movies during the pandemic. The film will be made freely available on May 1st after the Tampa Theatre run is completed.
