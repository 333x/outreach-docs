# Monero Konferenco

The first Monero Konferenco [monerokon.com](https://monerokon.com/) (Esperanto for Coin Conference), an annual conference focused on private currency, will be held in Denver on June 23 and 24 at the extraordinary Curtis Hotel. It will entertain and educate attendees on privacy and censorship-resistant financial technology.

The conference will cover multiple private cryptocurrencies, including Monero. Monero is well known for protecting the details of financial transactions, giving users the digital equivalent of fungible cash. It comes with the philosophy that private financial transactions are an important human right.

Realizing this philosophy requires new and special technologies in networking and encryption. Empowering users by hiding the sender, the receiver, and the amount of transactions, as Monero does, leverages innovative mathematics and software.

The conference will include presentations on these technologies as well as the philosophy of Monero and other private cryptocurrencies in seven sessions:

1. Protocols I
2. Secure Hardware and Software
3. Pools, Mines, and Work I
4. Privacy and Society
5. Protocols II
6. Breaking, Developing, and Advancing Monero
7. Pools, Mines, and Work II

Speakers include:

The conference will have an intercontinental panel discussion covering government regulation and privacy. The panel will include Jerry Brito and Peter Van Valkenburgh from Coin Center, Erik Voorhees from ShapeShift, and Jack Gavigan from Zcash. It will be live streamed between Colorado and Croatia in coordination with the cryptocurrency Zcash’s Zcon1.

“Financial privacy is foundational to human dignity and liberty,” said Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center. “Private electronic cash systems like Monero and Zcash will become increasingly important. Coin Center is thrilled to be part of this panel on both sides of the Atlantic.”

The Rocky Mountain Region was chosen as an ideal location for the conference, both attracting outsiders and offering a prominent local population of cryptocurrency and privacy enthusiasts.

“We found a great venue in the Mile-High City,” said Dr. Brandon Goodell, contributor at Monero Research Lab and Monero Konferenco organizer. “Research in computer science, mathematics, and cryptography enjoys a long tradition in the Rocky Mountains. I’ve been delighted about the increased interest in cryptocurrencies we’ve been seeing.”

The conference is supported financially, in part, by the Monero community to make the event affordable and accessible to the public. The cost is low to all, and special rates are available for students.

“There are so many good reasons to attend,” said Sarang Noether, a mathematical and cryptographic researcher at Monero Research Lab. “The conference promises to be an excellent opportunity for researchers and privacy enthusiasts to dive into the technology, meet like-minded peers, and learn.”
