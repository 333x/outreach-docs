# New Evidence Suggests Bitcoin Founder Satoshi Also Created Monero

**“Historical research and textual analysis now indicate Satoshi Nakamoto and Nicolas van Saberhagen may have been the same person or group.”**

**FOR RELEASE ON APRIL 1, 2020**

Bitcoin appeared during a financial crisis on October 31, 2008, with the release of a whitepaper authored by the unknown Satoshi Nakamoto. Three years later, December 12, 2012, saw the presentation of the technology behind the cryptocurrency Monero in a whitepaper authored by the unknown Nicolas van Saberhagen. Historical research and textual analysis now indicate Satoshi Nakamoto and Nicolas van Saberhagen may have been the same person or group.

Nakamoto, despite celebrity-level fame, has eluded identification. He, she, or they are largely defined through the document “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” called the [Bitcoin Whitepaper (PDF)](https://cryptonote.org/whitepaper_v1.pdf). It describes the multiple parts a cryptocurrency, including the blockchain and the proof-of-work algorithm that secures it without a central authority.

Saberhagen’s CryptoNote whitepaper, “CryptoNote 1.0,” also defined a new cryptocurrency, one focused on privacy and empowerment. It improved on Bitcoin by changing the blockchain structure and using a new proof-of-work, addressing issues that had arisen since Bitcoin’s invention. It also made a number of smaller enhancements to Bitcoin, like simplifying transaction scripts and dynamically adjusting block reward and size. The CryptoNote Whitepaper led to the creation of Monero.

The author of the Bitcoin Whitepaper had clear motive to write the [CryptoNote Whitepaper (PDF)](https://cryptonote.org/whitepaper_v1.pdf). In a newsgroup posting on August 13, 2010, Nakamoto first posted the concepts for privacy in cryptocurrency that would later appear in the CryptoNote Whitepaper: the ideas of stealth addresses, which hide receivers in a cryptocurrency transaction, and ring signatures, which hide senders. Also, by the time of the CryptoNote Whitepaper, Nakamoto had witnessed the struggles with Bitcoin’s block size changes (Nakamoto himself stealthfully inserted a 1 MB block size limit into the Bitcoin codebase in 2010) and mining reward halving that the new whitepaper tackled.

A Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the primary computational engine in personal computers. The Bitcoin Whitepaper advanced the concept of “one CPU one vote” in securing the network. But this directive had stopped working by the time of the CryptoNote whitepaper, as Bitcoin’s SHA-256-based proof-of-work algorithm had been ported to faster Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and implemented on Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICSs). Saberhagen’s new proof-of-work addressed exactly this.

“After watching philosophical ideals yield under the old design, Satoshi appears to have revised the algorithms,” said Almutasim, Monero Outreach Editor. “New knowledge, new insights, and three years of hard thinking by one of humanity’s greatest minds led to transcendent concepts in the CryptoNote Whitepaper.”

Writing analysis shows a clear style connection between the two whitepapers. Monero Outreach, in studies using the Java Graphical Authorship Attribution Program (JGAAP) stylometry software—applying the Burrows Delta Analysis Method—found that the author of the CryptoNote whitepaper was more likely to be the author of the Bitcoin whitepaper than the author of any of 15 leading papers selected from the Monero literature. Stylometry theory says Nicolas van Saberhagen’s writing has more in common with Satoshi Nakamoto’s than with 15 prominent Monero experts.

But JGAAP’s deep scientific algorithms are not strictly required, as clear visible parallels abound: Both whitepapers used the same unexpected spelling of “favour/favourable.” Both used the contraction “can’t” contrary to the usual style of academically formatted papers. Both used the wording “In this paper, we...” Both used black-and-white line drawings with solid and dashed lines. And so forth.

“You can look at the two documents side by side and get floored by the crazy similarities,” said Thunderosa, Monero Outreach Creative Lead. “Maybe we should start calling the author Satoshi van Saberhagen.”

With these historical motivations, scientific analysis, and compelling similarities, the stark truth of Satoshi Nakamoto being Nicolas van Saberhagen rises like a full moon over a calm ocean on a cloudless night. It gives new perspectives on what had been assumed to be two of the greatest inventors of our age: Nakamoto, the progenitor of all of cryptocurrency, and Saberhagen, the creator of cryptocurrency that protects human privacy and liberty.

Yet one should not expect this revelation to be embraced by either the Bitcoin or the Monero community—each with strong opinions and customs—overnight. There will be resistance.

“Like many, I’m still processing this,” said Xmrhaelan, Monero Outreach Organizer. “I will, though, say with confidence that if Satoshi Nakamoto is Nicolas van Saberhagen, Monero was Satoshi’s greatest work.”

“It could also be that this is all coincidence combined with results-tailorable academic software, with no real connection between the two authors. Maybe Nicolas van Saberhagen is actually a talented, creative, humble techie who admired Satoshi Nakamoto and wants to stay anonymous while hiding in plain sight,” said Almutasim.

“Even if we knew who Saberhagen really was, we wouldn’t tell,” added Thunderosa.
