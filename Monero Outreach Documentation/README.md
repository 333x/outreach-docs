# Monero Outreach

Welcome to the Monero Outreach Localization Workgroup. This repository will contain all the final versions of the documents published by the Monero Outreach Workgroup. 

This will also be the repository where translations will be worked upon. Read carefully the README.md files, they will give you basic instructions on how to work the translations.

## Goal

Our goal as a community is to create infrastructure and tools that can be used as an information bridge between core developers, community members, and the general public. We aim to ensure the public is informed of the many benefits of privacy and fungibility in cryptocurrencies.


### Contributing

Follow this instructions (if you are not familiar with Github, check out this [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)):

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork locally. 
2. The this repositorydirectory `en` has all the documents up-to-date. Open the folder and look for the document(s) and the file format you will be working on.
3. If you want to work on a new language, add a subfolder for your language in the `translations` directory, or create an issue with a message with the language you would like to work on. This will help us create the subfolder and add files (check if your language has not been created; [country codes](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim/Country_Codes)).
4. The documents should be submitted in pdf. When saving your file add the country code to the file name (e.g. "Quickfacts_es.pdf", "Quickfacts_es_printerfriendly.pdf", etc.).
5. When you edit the document, remember to add a message to the commit with **the documents name and the language** (e.g. "Fully translated the Quickfacts to fr", "Added missing punctuation Quickfacts to bg", etc.).
6. Happy contributing!
